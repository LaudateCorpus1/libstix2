STIX 2 Specification Text

The following information comes directly from the STIX 2 specification documents.

Threat Actors are actual individuals, groups, or organizations believed to be
operating with malicious intent. A Threat Actor is not an Intrusion Set but may
support or be affiliated with various Intrusion Sets, groups, or organizations
over time.

Threat Actors leverage their resources, and possibly the resources of an
Intrusion Set, to conduct attacks and run Campaigns against targets.

Threat Actors can be characterized by their motives, capabilities, goals,
sophistication level, past activities, resources they have access to, and their
role in the organization.
