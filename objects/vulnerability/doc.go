// Package vulnerability - This package defines the properties and methods needed to
// create a work with the STIX Vulnerability SDO.
//
// The following information comes directly from the STIX 2 specificaton documents:
//
// A Vulnerability is "a mistake in software that can be directly used by a hacker to gain access to a system or network" [CVE]. For example, if a piece of malware exploits CVE-2015-12345, a Malware object could be linked to a Vulnerability object that references CVE-2015-12345.
//
// The Vulnerability SDO is primarily used to link to external definitions of vulnerabilities or to describe 0-day vulnerabilities that do not yet have an external definition. Typically, other SDOs assert relationships to Vulnerability objects when a specific vulnerability is targeted and exploited as part of malicious cyber activity. As such, Vulnerability objects can be used as a linkage to the asset management and compliance process.
