Package malware implements the STIX 2 Malware Domain Object.
This package defines the properties and methods needed to create and work with
the STIX Malware SDO.

STIX 2 Specification Text

The following information comes directly from the STIX 2 specification documents.

Malware is a type of TTP that is also known as malicious code and malicious
software, and refers to a program that is inserted into a system, usually
covertly, with the intent of compromising the confidentiality, integrity, or
availability of the victim's data, applications, or operating system (OS) or of
otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim. Malware such as viruses and worms
are usually designed to perform these nefarious functions in such a way that
users are unaware of them, at least initially.

The Malware SDO characterizes, identifies, and categorizes malware samples and
families via a text description property. This provides detailed information
about how the malware works and what it does. Relationships from Malware can
capture what the malware targets (Vulnerability and Identity) and link it to
another Malware SDO that it is a variant of.
