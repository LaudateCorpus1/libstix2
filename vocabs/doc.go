STIX 2 Specification Text

The following information comes directly from the STIX 2 specification documents.

The following sections provide object-specific listings for each of the
vocabularies referenced in the object description sections defined in STIXâ„¢
Version 2.0. Part 2: STIX Objects. STIX vocabularies, which all have type names
ending in '-ov', are "open": they provide a listing of common and industry
accepted terms as a guide to the user but do not limit the user to that defined
list.
